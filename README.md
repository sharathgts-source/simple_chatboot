# simple_chatboot

This project is a simple, rule-based chatbot developed using Python. The chatbot uses if-elif-else conditional statements to simulate a conversation with a user. It processes user input, matches it against predefined keywords or phrases, and provides appropriate responses.

Unlike AI-based bots that use machine learning or NLP, this chatbot strictly follows predefined rules. It is designed as an introductory-level project for beginners to understand how decision-making and user interaction can be implemented in Python using loops and conditions.
